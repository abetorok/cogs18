# cogs18: Fantasy Basketball League Simulator 


 My project is a fantasy basketball draft where the user chooses a team from a pool of 25 players,
 while the computer selects a team as well. After each team has five players, they play in the same format of the NBA finals to determine the winner.
 The goal of the project was to practice with dictionaries and classes, as well as learning to organize code in ways that will scale well for larger projects.

## Requirements

The only thing you need to run cogs18 is python 3.

You can run the game, via:
```bash
python ./main.py
```
